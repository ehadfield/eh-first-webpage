      <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <p>
          Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,</br>
          We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.</br>
          All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon.</br>
          In the middle of the road.</br>
          And he said:</br>
          "Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul." (soul)
        </p>

        <p>
          Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,</br>
          And we each said. "Okay."
        </p>

        <p>
          And we played the first thing that came to our heads,</br>
          Just so happened to be,</br>
          The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.
        </p>

        <p>
          Look into my eyes and it's easy to see</br>
          One and one make two, two and one make three,</br>
          It was destiny.</br>
          Once every hundred-thousand years or so,</br>
          When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow</br>
          And the grass doth grow
        </p>

        <p>
          Needless to say, the beast was stunned.</br>
          Whip-crack went his whoopy tail,</br>
          And the beast was done.</br>
          He asked us: "(snort) Be you angels?"</br>
          And we said, "Nay. We are but men."</br>
          Rock!</br>
          Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,</br>
          Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not The Greatest Song in the World, no.</br>
          This is just a tribute.</br>
          Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.</br>
          This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World,</br>
          All right! It was The Greatest Song in the World,</br>
          All right! It was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the peculiar thing is this my friends:</br>
          The song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound</br>
          Anything like this song.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is just a tribute! You gotta believe it!</br>
          And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.</br>
          Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',</br>
          So surprised to find you can't stop it.
        </p>

        <p>
          All right! All right!
